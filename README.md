# pathfinding_CA

This repository contains the implementation of the CA for pathfinding as described in the article:

Syed, U. A. and Kunwar, F. _Cellular automata based real-time path-planning for mobile robots_, International Journal of Advanced Robotic Systems, 2014.

In order to provide mazes to test the code, [this repository](https://github.com/raulorteg/ai-maze-python.git) was used.
